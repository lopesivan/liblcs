<h3 class="section">4.1 Example Module 1</h3>

<p>
This section presents a simple example illustrating the construction of a module which is built as a grouping of other 
smaller modules. The aim is to present to the reader a technique of grouping smaller modules into a bigger module. The 
example builds a 1-bit full adder module using only the off-the-shelf logic gate modules provided in libLCS.


<h4 class="subsection">4.1.1 The logic equations for a 1-bit full adder</h4>

<p>
Let <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> be the two input bits and the carry input respectively. Let <code>S</code> and <code>C</code> 
be the sum and carry outputs respectively. Then, the following logic equations show the relation between the output
bits and the input bits of a 1-bit fulladder. 

<pre class="example">     S = a&amp;~b&amp;~c | ~a&amp;b&amp;~c | ~a&amp;~b&amp;c | a&amp;b&amp;c,
     C = a&amp;b&amp;~c | a&amp;~b&amp;c | ~a&amp;b&amp;c | a&amp;b&amp;c
</pre>
   <p>
The equations could be further simplified or written in terms of XOR logic. However, the idea here is not to 
implement the best fulladder module. It is to illustrate building a module as a grouping of other modules. The diagram 
for the logic circuit is as follows. The circular bubbles denote NOT gates.

<blockquote>
<div align="center"><img src="1fa.jpg" alt="1fa.jpg"></div>
   </blockquote>
   

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.2 The module class definition</h4>

<p>
Building a module as a group of smaller modules is equivalent to defining and implementing a C++ class encapsulating
the functionality of the desired module. We will build the fulladder module using only AND, OR and NOT gates. The 
definition of our fulladder module class is as follows. The variable names in the definition correspond to the naming 
in the above diagram.

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     
     class MyFullAdder
     {
       public:
           // Constructor argument description:
           // 1. The single line bus S corresponds to the sum output.
           // 2. The single line bus C corresponds to the carry output.
           // 3. The single line busses a and b correspond to the single bit inputs.
           // 4. The single line bus c corresponds to the carry input.
           MyFullAdder(const Bus&lt;1> &amp;S, const Bus&lt;1> &amp;C,
                       const Bus&lt;1> &amp;a, Bus&lt;1> &amp;b, Bus&lt;1> &amp;c);
     
           ~MyFullAdder();
     
       private:
           // NOT gates to generate the inverses of the input bits.
           Not&lt;> *nota, *notb, *notc; 
     
           // 3-input AND gates corresponding to the minterms for 
           // sum and carry outputs.
           And&lt;3> *sa1, *sa2, *sa3, *sa4, *ca1, *ca2, *ca3, *ca4;
     
           // 4-input OR gates to generate the final output.
           Or&lt;4> *sor, *cor;
     };
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>
The reader should refer to the API documentation (or the developer guide) and the chapter <a href="Introduction-to-libLCS.html#Introduction-to-libLCS">Introduction to libLCS</a>
to refresh and know more about the logic gate classes and the bus classes in libLCS. In this section, it is assumed that 
the user is familiar with these classes.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
There are two points which one should note from the above class definition: 1. The above module class constructor 
prototype specifies how one should/can initialise a fulladder module object. 2. All the private members of the class 
correspond to the logic gate modules which constitute our fulladder module. These points will in general hold for all 
modules which are implemented as a grouping of smaller modules.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
In the sub-section below, we will see the implementation of the constructor and the destructor. These implementations 
will show the reader as to how connections between the contituent modules of our fulladder module are made.


<h4 class="subsection">4.1.3 Implementation of the module class</h4>

<p>
We will first see the implementation of the constructor of the fulladder module. The bus variable names in the 
code is same as in the circuit diagram above.

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     
     MyFullAdder::MyFullAdder(const Bus&lt;1> &amp;S, const Bus&lt;1> &amp;C,
                              const Bus&lt;1> &amp;a, Bus&lt;1> &amp;b, Bus&lt;1> &amp;c)
     {
         // Declaration of connection busses.
         Bus&lt;> a_, b_, c_, s1, s2, s3, s4, c1, c2, c3, c4;
     
         // Each of the gates should be initialised with proper bus
         // connections. 
     
         // Initialising the NOT gates.
         nota = new Not&lt;>(a_, a); notb = new Not&lt;>(b_, b); notc = new Not&lt;>(c_, c);
     
         // Initialising the AND gates for the
         // minterms corresponding to the sum output.
         sa1 = new And&lt;3>(s1, (a_,b_,c)); sa3 = new And&lt;3>(s3, (a,b_,c_));
         sa2 = new And&lt;3>(s2, (a_,b,c_)); sa4 = new And&lt;3>(s4, (a,b,c));
     
         // Initialising the AND gates for the
         // minterms corresponding to the carry output.
         ca1 = new And&lt;3>(c1, (a_,b,c)); ca2 = new And&lt;3>(c2, (a,b_,c));
         ca3 = new And&lt;3>(c3, (a,b,c_)); ca4 = new And&lt;3>(c4, (a,b,c));
     
         // Initialising the OR gates which
         // generate the final outputs.
         sor = new Or&lt;4>(S, (s1,s2,s3,s4)), cor = new Or&lt;4>(C, (c1,c2,c3,c4));
     
     }
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>
The circuit, as shown in the above diagram, requires three NOT gates, eight 3-input AND gates, and two 4-input OR gates. 
These logic gates were initialised suitably in the above constructor implementation. The connection between the various 
logic gates are implicitly made when the logic gate modules are initialised by the passing the correct input and output 
bus arguments to the logic gate constructors. There are no special procedures to make the connections between modules 
in libLCS.
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Below is the <code>MyFullAdder</code> destructor implementation. The destructor will have to delete all the logic gate 
modules which were initialised in the constructor.

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     
     MyFullAdder::~MyFullAdder()
     {
         // The destructor should delete all  the gates
         // which were initialised during construction.
     
         delete nota; delete notb; delete notc;
         delete sa1; delete sa2; delete sa3; delete sa4;
         delete ca1; delete ca2; delete ca3; delete ca4;
         delete sor; delete cor;
     }
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>

<h4 class="subsection">4.1.4 2-bit Full Adder</h4>

<p>
We will now test the <code>MyFullAdder</code> class by building a 2-bit fulladder using two <code>MyFullAdder</code> modules. The 
circuit is as follows.

<blockquote>
<div align="center"><img src="1fa2.jpg" alt="1fa2.jpg"></div>
   </blockquote>
   
Building the above circuit is as simple as declaring the busses involved, and initialising the two <code>MyFullAdder</code> 
modules. This is done as follows.

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     
     // Declaring the busses involved in out circuit.
     // Note that the bus c0 (the carry input to the first full-adder)
     // has been initialised with a value of 0 (or lcs::LOW) on its line.
     Bus&lt;> a1, b1, a2, b2, c0(0), S1, C1, S2, C2;
     
     // Initialising the 1-bit full adder modules.
     MyFullAdder fa1(S1, C1, a1, a2, c0), fa2(S2, C2, b1, b2, C1);
</pre>
</pre>
   <p>
The complete program which builds a 2-bit fulladder using two <code>MyFullAdder</code> modules is as follows. One can copy 
this program as is into their favourite editor, and compile and run to see the result.

<pre class="example"><pre class="verbatim">     
     #include &lt;lcs/lcs.h>
     
     using namespace lcs;

       public:
           // Constructor argument description:
           // 1. The single line bus S corresponds to the sum output.
           // 2. The single line bus C corresponds to the carry output.
           // 3. The single line busses a and b correspond to the single bit inputs.
           // 4. The single line bus c corresponds to the carry input.
           MyFullAdder(const Bus&lt;1> &amp;S, const Bus&lt;1> &amp;C,
                       const Bus&lt;1> &amp;a, Bus&lt;1> &amp;b, Bus&lt;1> &amp;c);
     
           ~MyFullAdder();
     
       private:

     MyFullAdder::~MyFullAdder()

         // which were initialised during construction.
     
         delete nota; delete notb; delete notc;

   <p>
Apart from the constructs discussed earlier in this section, the above program initialises two <code>ChangeMonitor</code> 
objects and a <code>Tester</code> object. These constructs are discussed in detail in the section <a href="A-Simple-Example.html#A-Simple-Example">A Simple Example</a>. 
The reader should first refer to this section familiarise him-/herself with these classes and the class 
<code>Simulation</code>. 
   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
When the above program is compiled and executed, a VCD file is generated as we have initialised two 
<code>ChangeMonitor</code> objects with the <code>DUMP_ON</code>, one monitoring the input, and the other monitoring sum and 
carry outputs. The following is the screen shot of the GTKWave plot of the generated VCD file.
