<h3 class="section">2.4 Installing libLCS</h3>

<p>
This Section details instructions for building and installing the static library for libLCS. Currently, these 
instructions are relevant for all Linuxes, Cygwin and MinGW/MSYS with GCC-3.4.2 or higher. However, it should be 
possible to build the library on other platforms with appropriate modifications. If you are able to build the 
library on platforms other than those mentioned above, you are are encouraged to submit the build instructions to 
the libLCS project administrator (email to sivachandra[at]users[dot]sourceforge[dot]net). 


<h4 class="subsection">2.4.1 Building libLCS</h4>

<p>
The first step is to download the zipped/tarred bundle of the latest libLCS release from the sourceforge.net 
project page  
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/liblcs/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/liblcs/</a>.Next unzip/untar this file in a convenient directory. The contents of the zip/tar file are detailed in the 
<a href="Downloading-libLCS.html#Downloading-libLCS">Downloading libLCS</a> section. For ease of illustration, let us assume that the downloaded file has a name 
libLCS-a.b.x.zip. After unzipping/untarring, do the following.

<pre class="example">     cd libLCS-a.b.x/
     make all
</pre>
   <p>
This will build the static library into the directory <code>libLCS-a.b.x/lib/</code>, and all the examples into the 
directory <code>libLCS-a.b.x/bin/</code>. If you do not want to build the examples, then instead of the above command
sequence, do the following.

<pre class="example">     cd libLCS-a.b.x/ 
     make lib
</pre>
   <p>
If you would like to build the examples separately after building the static library, follow the above commands 
by 

<pre class="example">     make examples
</pre>
   <p>
This will build all the examples into the directory <code>libLCS-a.b.x/bin/</code>. You can do a final and optional 
<code>'make clean'</code> to clean up the object files, the built static library, and the built example binaries.


<h4 class="subsection">2.4.2 Installing libLCS</h4>

<p>
There are no special steps required to install the static library of libLCS once it has been successfully built. 
However, to begin using it in the easiest way, you will have to move the header files and the static library file 
to the standard include and linker paths. Copy the directory <code>lcs</code> as it is to the standard compiler include path 
(<code>lcs</code> is one of the directories packaged into the release zip/tar file for any particular libLCS release. See 
the <a href="Downloading-libLCS.html#Downloading-libLCS">Downloading libLCS</a> section for more information.) On most Linux like platforms, the standard compiler include 
path is <code>/usr/include/</code>. Similarly, copy the newly built static library file <code>lib/libLCS.a</code> to the standard 
linker path. On most Linux like platforms, the standard linker path is <code>/usr/lib/</code>. All you will typically 
need to do is to login as root and do the following in the unzipped/untarred <code>libLCS-a.b.x</code> directory.

<pre class="example">     cp -r lcs $COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATH
     cp lib/libLCS.a $LINKER_PATH
</pre>
   <p>
In the above command sequence <code>$COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATH</code> is the standard compiler include path, and the 
<code>$LINKER_PATH</code> is the standard linker path.
